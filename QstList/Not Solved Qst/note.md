1. Rotation using only O(1) extra space
Rotate [1,2,3,4,5] 2 steps to the left without creating a new array

2. Maximum element after rotation
Rotate [8, 3, 5, 2, 7] k steps. Find the maximum sum of i*arr[i] after rotation (classic rotation sum problem).

3. Array rotation in circular buffer
Simulate a queue using an array with rotations instead of shift/unshift.

4. Rotate a 2D matrix 90° clockwise
Input: [[1,2],[3,4]] → Output: [[3,1],[4,2]]

5. Cyclic rotation until a condition
Rotate [1,2,3,4,5] to the right until the first element is 4.

6. Subarray Sum Equals K
Find if there exists a subarray with sum equal to k.

7. Longest Consecutive Sequence
Find the length of the longest sequence of consecutive numbers in an unsorted array.
